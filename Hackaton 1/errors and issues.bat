Firebase Integration & Feature Rollout Workflow
1. Firebase Setup & Project Preparation
 Create Firebase Project (already done)
 Add your app in Firebase Console (Web app)
 Get your firebaseConfig code
 Install Firebase SDK (via CDN or npm)
 Create firebaseConfig.js and initialize Firebase in your project
2. Authentication
 Enable Email/Password Auth (and optionally Google, Facebook, etc.) in Firebase Console
 Update login and signup forms to use Firebase Auth
 Implement signup, login, logout, and session persistence
 Show/hide UI based on authentication state (user logged in vs. not)
3. User Roles & Profiles
 On Signup, save user role (admin/mentor) in Firestore along with user info
 Implement role-based redirects and UI (admin dashboard vs. mentor dashboard)
 Create user profile page (view/update name, email, etc.)
4. Mentor Session Management
 Allow mentors to log teaching sessions (save to Firestore)
 Admin can view all sessions, filter by status/mentor
 Admin can approve/reject sessions (update Firestore)
5. Automated Payouts
 When sessions are approved, calculate payout amount for each mentor
 Store payout status/history in Firestore
 Admin can mark payouts as processed
6. Receipt Generation
 When payout is processed, generate a receipt (PDF or HTML)
 Store/downloadable receipts in Firestore or Storage
7. Real-Time Chat (Support/Direct Messaging)
 Design chat data structure in Firestore
 Implement real-time chat UI for mentor-admin/support
 Add notifications for new messages
8. Analytics & Reporting
 Set up Firestore queries/Cloud Functions for reports:
Total payouts, sessions, activity per mentor
 Add analytics dashboard for admin
9. Security & Rules
 Write Firestore Security Rules for:
Authenticated user access
Role-based data access
Safe writes/reads
 Test rules thoroughly
10. Polish, Test, and Deploy
 Test all user flows (signup, session, chat, payouts, etc.)
 Add error handling, loading indicators, and UX polish
 Deploy frontend (Firebase Hosting or other)
 Set up monitoring/analytics
