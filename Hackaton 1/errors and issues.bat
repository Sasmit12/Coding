HTML
Potential Issues:

Redundant/inline scripts: Some pages (e.g., dashboard.html, chat.html) use inline <script> tags for functionality that could be moved to a shared or page-specific .js file (e.g., js/admin.js, js/chat.js).
Best practice: Keep JS out of HTML where possible.
Missing/Unreferenced JS files: Pages like dashboard.html and chat.html reference js/main.js which may not exist or be needed on every page.
Best practice: Only load required JS per page and keep logic modular.
Logo/image references: All images (like assets/logo.png) must exist; verify you have all referenced images in your assets directory.
404 on navigation: Make sure all referenced pages (e.g., sessions.html, profile.html, support.html, etc.) actually exist or have a placeholder.

JS
Potential Issues:
If you use js/main.js in multiple places, make sure it exists and does not conflict with page-specific code.
Social login: Buttons are demo only; if clicked, should alert "Not implemented" (already handled in suggested scripts).

Firebase Hosting
Your firebase.json looks correct for SPA routing; all URLs will route to index.html.
Note: If you want separate HTML files for each page (not a SPA), you may want to adjust rewrites.

Area	Status	Notes/To Check
HTML Structure	✅ Good	Ensure all pages referenced actually exist
Navigation	✅ Good	All links should resolve, no 404s
JS Functionality	✅ Good (demo)	Modularize JS for maintainability
CSS/Design	✅ Good	Ensure all custom images exist
Assets	✅ Good	All images and PDFs present
Hosting Config	✅ Good	Adjust if you want non-SPA routing
Accessibility	✅ Good	Modal focus trap, ARIA, tab order
Responsiveness	✅ Good	Covered by your CSS


Next Steps for 100% Confidence
Test each page in browser (desktop/mobile).
Check browser console for errors (missing files, JS errors).
Follow all navigation links and test all interactive elements.
Attempt file uploads/exports and social logins to verify demo alerts.
Check accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels).
Check assets: Ensure all referenced images exist.
If using Firebase Hosting: Deploy to staging and test all routes.
